# -DIABETES-CLASSIFICATION-By-studying-the-impact-of-Feature-Engineering
The document in your hands is our project of DIABETES CLASSIFICATION, the main objective of the project is to be able to implement some or all machine learning techniques using a dataset for classification or regression. In
our case, we have chosen the Pima Indians Diabetes Database which is a dataset in Kaggle for classification challenge purposes. In the next chapters we will be talking first about the project
and have a general idea of what we trying to do and achieve from it and our methodology of work using CRISP-DM then we will have a general idea of what is machine learning followed
by Realization chapter were we gonna explain each of the models ’SVM’, ’Logistic Regression’, ’Decision Tree’, ’Na¨ıve Bays’, ’Random Forest’ and approaches ’new features’, ’Grid search’ we have used to predict and improve our predictions and sealing it with a comparison
of the results of each model with the different techniques and combine all model suing voting technique.
